Let \(T \colon \CC^2 \to \CC^2\) be the transformation defined by
\[
  T(x, y) = (y, x).
\]
Let \(G = \abracket{T}\) be the group generated by \(T\).
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
\item Prove \(G \le GL(\CC^2)\) and identify all elements of \(G\).
\item Prove that \(G \circlearrowright \CC^2\), i.e. \(G\) acts on
  \(\CC^2\), and show that \(\CC^2\) is a \(G\)-module.
\item Express this representation of \(G\) as a matrix representation
  by finding the matrix corresponding to each element of \(G\).
\item Find all of the submodules of this representation of \(G\),
  i.e. find all of the \(G\)-invariant subspaces of \(\CC^2\).
\end{enumerate}
